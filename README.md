## Introduction

Slouched over, immersed in flow state, getting inspiring work done—that’s what I love most—without the slouching part, of course. Like many developers, students, and lifelong learners, I often lose track of time, only realizing my posture has taken a toll when my neck and back start aching. The irony? The very pain that should remind me to move sometimes makes me slouch even more. I overlook taking breaks, dismissing them as distractions. In reality, a simple stretch could make all the difference.

That’s where **CatCow** steps in! Inspired by my favorite yoga pose, a playful, loving kitty gently reminds users to pause, stretch, and reconnect with their bodies. With two categories of **seated** and **standing** exercises designed for busy desk users, CatCow understands that movement isn’t a chore—it’s a reward, a moment of self-care that brings balance to long hours of deep work.

With every stretch, peek, and playful nudge, CatCow helps users build a **healthier and happier lifestyle**. It’s more than just posture correction; it’s about fostering small, meaningful habits that prioritize well-being without disrupting focus. Because feeling good shouldn’t be an afterthought.
